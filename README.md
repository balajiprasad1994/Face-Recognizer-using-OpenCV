Facial recognizer application using OpenCV library 
•	Uses Haar-Cascade classifier for face detection and Fisher face algorithm for collection of features of the detected face.
•	Machine learning Algorithm has been used to compare features of the detected face with the faces stored in the database and identifies the right one.
